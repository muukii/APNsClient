# Verge - Flux and ORM for creating iOS App with SwiftUI and UIKit

## Verge 7.0.0 Beta

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1888355/80621676-98133a80-8a82-11ea-952f-3c3e52f9c222.png)

> ðŸš§ Verge 7.0 is still in development. API and the concept of Verge might be changed a bit.

[**ðŸ”— You can see more detail of Verge on Documentation**](https://muukii-app.gitbook.io/verge/)

**A Store-Pattern based data-flow architecture.**

```swift
struct State: StateType {
  var name: String = ""
  var age: Int = 0
}

enum Activity {
  case somethingHappen
}

// ðŸŒŸwith UIKit
class ViewController: UIViewController {
  
  ...  
  
  let store = Store<State, Activity>(initialState: .init(), logger: nil)
  
  ...
            
  func update(changes: Changes<State>) {
    
    changes.ifChanged(\.name) { (name) in
      nameLabel.text = name
    }
    
    changes.ifChanged(\.age) { (age) in
      ageLabel.text = age.description
    }
    
  }
}


// ðŸŒŸwith SwiftUI
struct MyView: View {
  
  @EnvironmentObject var store: Store<State, Activity>
  
  var body: some View {
    Group {
      Text(store.state.name)
      Text(store.state.age)
    }
  }
}
```

## Overview

The concept of Verge Store is inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) and [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift).

Plus, releasing from so many definition of the actions.<br>
To be more Swift's Style on the writing code.

`store.myOperation()` instead of `store.dispatch(.myOperation)`

The characteristics are

* **Creates one or more Dispatcher. \(Single store, multiple dispatcher\)**
* **A dispatcher can have dependencies service needs. \(e.g. API Client, DB\)**
* **No switch-case to handle Mutation and Action**
* **Emits any events that isolated from State It's for SwiftUI's onReceive\(:\)**
* **Supports Logging \(Commit, Action, Performance monitoring\)**
* **Supports binding with Combine and RxSwift**
* **Supports normalizing the state with ORM.**

## What differences between other Flux libraries in the iOS application world

Firstly, Verge provides the functions to keep excellent performance in using Store-Pattern.

Verge focuses on using in the real-world.

For example, the application must have many features depends on its business.<br>
Such as the application might be getting complicated.

To solve this issue, we can choose Store-Pattern such as flux.

At a glance, Flux architecture is amazing.<br>
However, we have to follow the disadvantages behind it.

They are coming from the application runs with Data-Driven (Mostly).<br>
Data-Driven will cause some expensive calculations in the application that depends on the complexity of the application.<br>
Sometimes, we may face some performance issues we can't overlook it.

Redux and Vuex are already following that.

- Redux
  - reselect
  - ORM
- Vuex
  - Getters
  - ORM

Verge is trying to do that in iOS application with Swift.

Specifically:
- Derived
- ORM

## Prepare moving to SwiftUI from now with Verge

SwiftUI's concept is similar to the concept of React, Vue, and Elm. <br>
Therefore, the concept of state management will become to be similar as well.

That is Redux or Vuex and more.

Now, almost of iOS Applications are developed on top of UIKit.<br>
And We can't say SwiftUI is ready for top production. <br>
However, it would change.

It's better to use the state management that fits SwiftUI from now. It's not only for that, current UIKit based applications can get more productivity as well.

## Usage

[Please check it from here](https://muukii-app.gitbook.io/verge/)

## Modules overview

### Store

It provides core functions of Store-pattern.

- State supports computed property with caching (like [Vuex's Getters](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html))
- Derived object to create derived data from state-tree with performant (like [redux/reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect))

### ORM

It provides the function that manages performant many entity objects.<br>
Technically, using Normalization.

In the application that uses many entity objects, we sure highly recommend using such as ORM using Normalization.

About more detail,
https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape

### Rx Extensions

It provides several observable that compatible with RxSwift.

## Installation

With Cocoapods,

VergeStore

```ruby
pod 'Verge/Store'
```

VergeORM

```ruby
pod 'Verge/ORM'
```

VergeRx

```ruby
pod 'Verge/Rx'
```

These are separated with subspecs in Podspec.<br>
After installed, these are merged into single module as `Verge`.

To use Verge in your code, define import decralation following.

```swift
import Verge
```
