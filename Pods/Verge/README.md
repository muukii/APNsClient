![Data flow](.gitbook/assets/loop-2x.png)

**A Store-Pattern based data-flow architecture.**

```swift
struct State: StateType { ... }

let store: MyStore = ...

let dispatcher: MyDispatcher = ...

dispatcher.commit { $0.increment() }

dispatcher.dispatch { $0.asyncIncrement() }
```

The concept of VergeStore is inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).

The characteristics are

* **Creates one or more Dispatcher. \(Single store, multiple dispatcher\)**
* **A dispatcher can have dependencies service needs. \(e.g. API Client, DB\)**
* **No switch-case to handle Mutation and Action**
* **Supports Logging \(Commit, Action, Performance monitoring\)**

Verge provides several packages each use-cases.
